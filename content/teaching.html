<td>2014-1 Spring; 2013-3 Fall; 2012-3 Fall</td>
<td>Yaorong Ge</td>
<td>This course is targeting students in the Health Informatics master program who have no formal computer science and IT training. We will help the students understand the concepts, principles, and skills of Information Technology and Computer Science as they are applied to health care. Topics include major concepts in computers and their components, system and application software, programming paradigms, databases, networks, Internet, Web, security, communications, data formats and media, data representations, and technology trends. The course will also explore technological challenges and constraints introduced by the intricacies of health care delivery and management as well as related ethics issues and regulations.

<td>In this course we will help the students to obtain a deep understanding of (a) how computer-based health information systems are designed, tested and installed in hospital and clinics of all sizes; (b) the history, evolution, state-of-art and issues of healthcare information systems; (c) the regulations, laws and standards applied to healthcare information systems; and (d) evaluation and adoption of clinical, administrative, and specialty information technology applications for health organizations. We will achieve the goals by lectures and discussions, laboratory exercises (on a real Clinical Information System), practical case studies, homework and term projects.

<td>Complex Adaptive Systems</td>
<td>2016-1 Spring; 2015-1 Spring</td>
<td>Mirsad Hadzikadic</td>
<td>Complex system consist of a network of parts whose interactions give rise to interesting properties including self-orgaganization, non-linearity,and emergence. Self-organization is a process where the organization of a system spontaneously increases. New, emergent properties appear.Ant colonies, networks of neurons, the immune system, the internet, and the global economy are a few examples where the behaviour of the whole is much more complex than the behavior of the parts(non-linearity).Cells, tissues, human body, health care organizations,epidemics and healthcare policy issues represent health related examples of complex systems.This course will cover these and similar topics in an instructor lead, self-exploratory manner.</td>
