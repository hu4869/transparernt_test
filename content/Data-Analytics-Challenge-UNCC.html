<div id="myDive">
 Are you interested in playing with data in the healthcare domain?<br/>
	Are you interested in winning $2,500 prize for doing an excellent job on that?<br/></div><p style="text-align:center;">Here is an opportunity:</p>
<p>As the leading effort at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, the Data Science Initiative (DSI) aims to train and develop
	 a new generation of data scientists, business analysts, and managers who will have both technical skills and business knowledge to
	 transform data into smart and innovative solutions for big challenges faced by today’s industry and business organizations. In addition
	 to the well-grounded multidisciplinary curricula, we are pleased to announce the first DSI Data Analytics Challenge, a special competition
	 event to enable the students to apply what they learn to significant real-world problems, and stimulating and inspiring their innovation. </p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The challenge is open to all officially registered students at UNC Charlotte.</li>
<li><strong>Students need to register as a team of up to 4 people by Midnight March 19 (Saturday), 2016. Please send an email to <a href="mailto:czhou5@uncc.edu">Chencheng Zhou (czhou5@uncc.edu)</a>
	and copy the same email to <a href="mailto:xniu2@uncc.edu">Dr. Xi Niu (xniu2@uncc.edu)</a>.  In your email, please include the name, 800-number, email address of each team member, project preference and faculty advisor (if known).</strong>
	Considering the nature of the selected challenge topics, the students are highly encouraged to form a multidisciplinary team of different backgrounds and skill sets.</li>
<li>The participating teams will have approximately 4 months to work on one selected topic out of two. The final presentation and competition will be
	scheduled before the start of Fall semester (Specific date to be announced). </li>
<li>There will be two winning teams, each for one challenge topic respectively.  The prize for each winning team will be $2,500. Additional industrial
	sponsorship might add up to the prize.</li>
<li>Each team can identify a faculty advisor. If needed, the organization committee will also provide assistance to identify and match faculty to student teams. </li>
<li>We will host a Q&amp;A meeting during the week of March 21-25 to further explain the time framework, deliverables and evaluation criteria. </li>

<p><strong>Topic instruction</strong></p>
<p>This year our theme is to apply data analytics to improve our health. We have prepared two challenge topics:</p>
<p><strong>I) Boost Serendipitous Discoveries For Online Health Information</strong></p>
<p>According to Pew Internet and American Life Project in 2014, 77% of the U.S. Internet users had looked online for health information in the past year,
	 most likely due to the accessibility, convenience, and confidentiality of online information. However, people often feel difficult to find comprehensive information.
	 They may have “blind spots” when looking for what they need online.  This is partly because medical topics usually have strong but hidden associations because a human
	 body has huge amounts of synergies. For example, some dental problems may have strong associations with diabetes. People may not know this association because of lack
	 of professional knowledge. When searching for health information, they may tend to focus on their specific dental problems without any attention to diabetes.</p>
<p>This challenge aims at using data and text mining methods to identify medical topic associations without using any background medical knowledge. The student team will
	 be given a list of common medical topics (such as diabetes, distress, and sleeping disorder). The dataset contains 100 common and popular medical topics, extracted from
	 multiple online resources. These 100 medical topics make up a list of 4,950 topic pairs ((100 * 99)/2). The students can use any data or text analytics techniques to
	 automatically <u>identify</u> the association strengths between these topics.  The final submission will be a report illustrating the underlying computational methods and models,
	 together with a ranked list of associations. We will then have experts evaluate your methods and compare the results to our ground truth annotation by two physicians. </p>
<p><strong>II) Mining Social Media Data to Identify Heavy Drinking in College Students</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Abusive alcohol consumption and underage drinking are serious, chronic problems faced by US colleges and universities, including UNC Charlotte. The direct consequences
	 include alcohol-related injuries and death, sexual assault or rape, drug abuse and academic difficulties. Studies show that college students embrace the “drinker” image
	 on social media websites, such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Instragram, valuing it as a socially desirable identity. They also tend to overestimate the amount and
	 frequency with which their peers drink, and this perception generates internal pressure to conform to the false norm. Since students conclude that heavy drinking is normal,
	 they do not seek preventive or interventional health care at student health centers or elsewhere. Thus, in addition to available community prevention efforts, innovative
	 approaches are needed to use social media more effectively to identify college students with heavy drinking tendencies and simultaneously counter the misperceptions and
	 encourage them to refrain from drinking or seek treatment. </p>
<p>More specifically an interesting and relevant question is: <strong>Can we mine the social media (i.e., Facebook) data to identify heavy drinking students?</strong> The student team needs
	 to answer the questions from two perspectives: First, build a machine learning classifier to <u>predict</u> if a user post on Facebook contains drinking-related content. We will
	 provide a de-identified dataset from Facebook, which records both the textual and multimedia contents anonymous college students posted on <i>Im Shamacked</i> group. Each message,
	 image and video clip is annotated and labeled whether the content is related to drinking or not. Second, <u>identify</u> the posting patterns of heavy drinking college students.
	 Ideally through surveys and/or observational behavior study, the student team needs to summarize if it is possible to distinguish heavy drinkers from normal social drinkers
	 based on their profile and activities on social media sites. It is a <i>plus</i> if they could propose without implementation a treatment plan on how to help those students who are
	 identified as heavy drinkers on social media. Our evaluation will be based on the plausibility of the features and the performance of machine learning predictions on independent
	 test data.</p>
