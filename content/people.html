                                        has over thirty years of information technology experience combining
                                        business and academic environments.  Dr. Hadzikadic joined the UNC Charlotte
                                        faculty in 1987 after receiving his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Southern
                                        Methodist University where he was a Fulbright Scholar.  In addition to publishing
                                        his scholarship, he has made presentations at national and international
                                        conferences, leading information technology firms, and universities.
                                        His research/scholarship activities have been primarily focused on: data mining,
                                        cognitive science, medical informatics, and complex adaptive systems. From 1991
                                        to 1997, Mirsad served as the Director of the Department of Medical Informatics
                                        and Department of Orthopedic Informatics of the Carolinas HealthCare System.
                                        In 1998, he joined Deloitte and Touche Consulting Group as Manager in the Health
                                        Systems Integration Service Line.  He returned full time to the University in
                                        January 1999 to assume the chair position in Computer Science and serve as Associate
                                        Director of the School of Information Technology.  Mirsad helped to shepherd the
                                        transition from a school in the College of Engineering into an independent College
                                        of Computing and Informatics, and served as its Founding Dean.  Mirsad is currently
                                        serving as the Founding Director of the Complex Systems Institute at UNC Charlotte.
                                        His current research interests include critical aspects of creativity/innovation,
                                        foundational aspects of the complexity theory, and the systems view of policies in
                                        financial services, economics, defense, healthcare, and political science. </p>

                                        Dr. Yaorong Ge comes to the
                                        Department of Software and Information Systems as a tenured
                                        Associate Professor after serving as an Associate Professor in the Department
                                        of Biomedical Engineering and the Center of Biomedical Informatics at Wake
                                        Forest University Health Sciences (WFUHS). He received his Ph.D. in Computer
                                        Science-Medical Engineering from Vanderbilt University (1995). Dr. Ge has
                                        extensive experience in imaging informatics and medical informatics. He was a
                                        part of the virtual colonoscopy research group that initiated and advanced
                                        the development of virtual colonoscopy, a minimally invasive technology for
                                        colorectal cancer screening. His expertise in imaging includes image registration,
                                        segmentation, skeletonization, computer-aided diagnosis, and radiology structured
                                        reporting. Dr. Ge also has strong experience in industry-strength software
                                        development. He co-founded and managed a medical software company to
                                        commercialize virtual colonoscopy and radiology structured reporting technologies.
                                        As Chief Technology Officer of the company, he established rigorous software
                                        engineering processes and a strong engineering team that produced state-of-the-art,
                                        FDA cleared imaging information systems, as well as a clinical ontology for radiology
                                        reporting. After the startup was acquired by IDX Corporation, an industry leader in
                                        healthcare IT before being merged into GE Healthcare, he became the Director of the
                                        software development team of IDXâ€™s radiology information system division. Since
                                        returning to academia in mid 2006, Dr. Ge has been focusing on imaging informatics
                                        research and ontology-based informatics systems development, which includes research
                                        ontologies, data grids, and data discovery and mining algorithms. </p></div>
