<p>Over past few decades, growing use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) systems have established large practice-based clinical datasets, which are emerging as valuable resources for clinical and translational research. One of the major challenges of using EHR for clinical research is that much of detailed patient information is embedded in narrative reports. This presentation will describe our recent development of natural language processing (NLP) methods for extracting phenotypic information from clinical text in EHR, as well as how such NLP methods can be used to support clinical research, such as drug outcome studies.</p>
