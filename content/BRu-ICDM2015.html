<div class="infoR"><h3><strong>Boshu won best paper award at 2015 ICDM DMBIH Workshop</strong></h3>
<p>Congratulations to Boshu Ru! He gave a presentation titled “A Content Analysis of Patient-Reported Medication Outcomes on Social Media” on the 15th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM2015) and won the best paper award in the Data Mining in Biomedical Informatics and Healthcare Workshop.</p>
<p>In this study, Ru and colleagues evaluated the medication outcome information shared among patients on four social media sites, WebMD, PatientsLikeMe, Twitter and YouTube, in terms of the data quantity and quality. The findings unveil the potential of social media as a complementary new data source for studying medication outcomes.

<p>Boshu also received ICDM2015 Student Travel Awards to attend the conference.</p>
