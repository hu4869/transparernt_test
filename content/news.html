<h2>Boshu builds an information system prototype to identify serendipitous drug usages in the patient forum data</h2>
<span>Feb-2017</span>
<p>Boshu Ru and his dissertation advisor Dr. Lixia Yao investigated whether social media data can be a new, independent data source to be combined with other existing data sources to generate stronger drug repositioning signals and reduce the false positive rate. This work was presented at the 10th International Conference on Health Informatics at Porto, Portugal (acceptance rate: 21%).

<span>May-2016</span>
<p>Our PhD students, Boshu Ru and Yi Zhen, joined Philips Research for two internship positions at Cambridge, Massachusetts during this summer. Boshu’s internship is focused on healthcare data analytics by developing data analytics prototypes and integrating large volumes of claim data with database techniques. Yi’s internship is primarily about applying natural language processing techniques to analyze clinical trial data for clinical bioinformatics purpose. Let's congratulate both of them!
